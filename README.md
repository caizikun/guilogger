Guilogger
=========
We describe a scheme for systematically testing the operation of a graphical user interface. The
scheme provides a capability for generating event logs, which are recordings of a user session with
the interface. These logs can be annotated with assertion statements, comparing reference test
data with data retrieved by introspection on the GUI elements. Such an annotated log forms a
test case, suitable for incorporation into a regression test suite.

Description
===========
It is well established among software developers that systematic testing of software,
whether against a formal design specification or against a less formal case-by-case asses-
ment of correct functionality, is a critical part of the software development cycle, and crucial
to the production of high-quality software.

Much formal testing methodology revolves around viewing software products as essen-
tially functions, in the mathematical sense, abstractly taking a single input from some large
domain, performing a computation, and producing a single output. Increases in both the
raw power of computers and in the power and scope of software development tools have lead
to increasing complexity in software. Presenting this complexity to the user in a compre-
hensible way demands a graphical user interface, which has its own complexity, and makes
the software a stateful, interactive machine. While it is still true that the software can
be thought of as a function, now the inputs and outputs have to be considered to be the
full state of the program and its GUI. This complicates the application of traditional test-
ing methods. At the same time, the GUI raises the bar for the expected reliability — it
allows users more rapid access to potentially-overlooked corner cases, and encourages the
expectation that all aspects of the program will “just work”.

Contact with formal testing methodology can be restored by the introduction of system-
atic ways of testing of a graphical user interface. In this article, we take a step in that
direction, describing the construction of a testing kit, that allows a user session with a GUI
to be recorded and played back, and that allows the state of the GUI widgets to be queried
at repeatable locations within the session, ensuring both correctness and consistency of the
*GUI* state.

For our example, we use the *GIMP Tool Kit* (*GTK*) widget set1, specifically *gtk+*, version
2.6 or later, and its Python wrappers, *PyGTK2* . We have created a Python module, called
gtklogger, which can be used to record, replay, and test a program with a *PyGTK* user
interface. gtklogger was developed specifically to test the OOF3 project at *NIST*, but can
easily be applied to other *PyGTK* programs. This paper includes instructions for extending
*gtklogger* to handle *PyGTK* objects that were not used in *OOF*.

*NOTE*: The full technical report can be found in the references.

Contributors
============
This project is meant to share the concept developed by the *OOF team* at the National Institute
of Standards and technology. The OOF GUI benefited a lot from the first implementation of that concept
for *GTK*.

We encourage you to contribute to that project, since it is providing a different of designing a *GUI*
testing toolkit as you have glenced from the description and probably understood from the technical
report.

The *gtklogger* is there for anybody coding a *GUI* based *GTK* app. So use it and let us know what you
think about it. If you want to add some features or fix some issues that you encountered, please
feel free to contact us.

We also motivate the implementation of this concept for other GUI toolkits. We are thinking of:
*Qt*, *Glui*, *Juce*, *gladexml*, *jqueryUI*, *capuccino*, etc...
For each case the namming standard will be [toolkit-name]logger. As you see '*gtklogger*'.
